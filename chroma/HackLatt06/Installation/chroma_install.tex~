\section{Preliminaries}
This set of notes describes the work necessary for the installation
of the Chroma software system. Chroma has been designed to be highly portable,
and so far has been built on the following diverse number of systems:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Linux and Cygwin scalar workstations
\item
PC Clusters running Linux with the following fabrics
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Myrinet machines using MPICH-GM for communications
\item
GigE machines using M-Via based Gigabit Ethernet communications harness
\item
Ethernet based systems using MPICH-MPI communications
\end{itemize}
\item
QCDOC machines using QCDOC-s QMP implementation
\item
IBM P-series computers using MPI based QMP harness
\item
BlueGene/L machines using MPI base QMP harness
\end{itemize}

The price of this level of portability is layering of software components.
This has resulted in quite a complicated software map of various dependent software. We show the software map in fig. \ref{f:SoftwareMap}.
