<h1>The HackLatt 2006 Chroma Tutorial</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Chroma tutorial of the HackLatt 2006 workshop on 
lattice QCD codes.</p>

<h2>The workshop presentations</h2>
<p>The presentations can be found here:
<ul>
 <li>An introduction to Chroma <a href="Presentations/ChromaIntro.odp">OpenOffice.org v2</a>, <a href="Presentations/ChromaIntro.ppt">PowerPoint Conversion</a>, <a href="Presentations/ChromaIntro.pdf">PDF</a></li>
 <li>QDP++ Low level plumbing for Chroma <a href="Presentations/ChromaPlumbing.odp">OpenOffice.org v2</a>, <a href="Presentations/ChromaPlumbing.ppt">PowerPoint Conversion</a>, <a href="Presentations/ChromaPlumbing.pdf">PDF</a></li>
 <li>Design Patterns in Chroma <a href="Presentations/DesignPatternsInChroma.odp">OpenOffice.org v2</a>, <a href="Presentations/DesignPatternsInChroma.ppt">PowerPoint Conversion</a>, <a href="Presentations/DesignPatternsInChroma.pdf">PDF</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>The tutorial Material</h2>

The practical tutorials are below:
<ul>
  <li><a href="./tutorial1.html"><b>Tutorial 1: Measurement with <tt>chroma</tt></b></a> This tutorial presents the main <tt>chroma</tt> application and goes in detail through a single configuration spectroscopy measurement.</li>
  <li><a href="./tutorial2.html"><b>Tutorial 2: More measurement with <tt>chroma</tt></b></a> This tutorial takes you through the computation of a pion for an ensemble of 5 8x8x8x16 configurations</li>
  <li><a href="./tutorial3.html"><b>Tutorial 3: Hacking with Chroma</b></a> - This tutorial takes you through various programming exercises, from mucking about with XML to invoking Factories and linkage.</li>
  <li><a href="./tutorial4.html"><b>Tutorial 4: Writing your own inline measurement</a></b> -- does just as advertised. You go through the anatomy of an inline measurement and have to deal with named objects</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<h3>Code Versions</h3>
<p>
Like all codes chroma is evolutionary. I have carried out the tutorial exercises here using
<ul>
  <li>QDP tagged version <tt>qdp1-20-1</tt></li>
  <li>Chroma tagged version <tt>chroma2-15-2</tt></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>We try to keep versions up to date but even looking at the output in this tutorial you will find that some output XML quotes the QDP++ version as 1.19.0 rather than 1.20.1. Sorry about that</p>
<p>
We are anticipating changes to the API in version 3 of chroma. This may break
some of the exercises (Tutorial 3: Exercises 5 and 6 in particular). Please
be aware of this.</p>

<h3>Compiling and Installing Chroma</h3>
<p>
We have begun writing document about compiling and installing chroma. The document can be found  <a href="Installation/html/index.html"> here</a>.</p>

<p>It currently covers installation in a non-parallel mode on a linux workstation using GNU 
g++. However it should be a reasonable springboard. However, do be aware 
of the information below:
</p>

<p>
Chroma has grown to be quite a complex piece of software. The current map of software modules required for a full build is shown in the image below:

</p>

<p>Fortunately, on a Pentium or other SSE assembly capable GNU/Linux or Cygwin workstations, building is relatively straightforward because the third party <tt>gmp</tt> and <tt>libxml2</tt> libraries are shipped as standard with most linux distributions (or are available as easily installable packages). The 
<tt>autoconf</tt> and <tt>automake</tt> packages are also shipped with most
linux (and other UN*X) systems however they are frequently out of date. We currently require <tt>autoconf-2.58</tt> and <tt>automake-1.9.3</tt>.

<p> Also the SSE assembly code needed for efficiency is distributed with the QDP++ and Chroma source. On such a platform there is no need for the BAGEL libraries or QMP.</p>
