Wait a minute. Didn't I say we don't need to modify <tt>chroma.cc</tt> for a
new measurement? How come I need to modify <tt>chroma.cc</tt>. Let's discuss
this.</p>


<h2>The hacked <tt>chroma.cc</tt></h2>
<p>
Edit the <tt>chroma.cc</tt> file. The modifications are as follows:
<ul>
<li>On line 8 I added <tt>#include "inline_my_meas.h"</tt>. If this
new measurement were part of the chroma library, this file would automatically
be included by including <tt>chroma.h</tt>. As we are developing externally
to the library we need to include it.</li>
<li>On line 74 I added the following line to the <tt>linkageHack</tt>:
<blockquote><tt>
  foo &= InlineMyMeasEnv::registerAll();
</tt></blockquote>
which just links in the measurement into the code.
Again, if we added this measurement to the Chroma library, this line 
would be done by the preceding:
<blockquote><tt>
  foo &= InlineAggregateEnv::registerAll();
</tt></blockquote>
which ensures registration for all inline measurements.</li>
</ul>
But the point stands, or more correctly it stands like this:
As we add new inline measurements to the library, we don't need
to modify <tt>chroma.cc</tt>. We only have to do it here, because
our code is not integrated into the library the usual way.
This linkage problem is exactly the same that you may have
met in the last tutorial when dealing with factories (and 
for exactly the same reason).
</p>

<h2>The source file: <tt>inline_my_meas.h</tt></h2>
<p>
Edit the file <tt>inline_my_meas.h</tt> file. This is a pretty 
bog standard C++ <tt>.h</tt> file, with an include guard at the 
start and end, and all the code going into namespace <tt>Chroma</tt>.
</p>

<p>We then define a namespace particular to the measurement: <tt>InlineMyMeasEnv</tt> Here we
will put the name of the measurement, deal with parameters, and factory registration. The latter is accomplished by defining a <tt>registerAll()</tt> which will register our measurement (and any other ones we may need). The return value is a boolean indicating a successful registration or otherwise by returning true or false respectively.</p>


<p>We define a parameter structure for the measurement. This is 
what the XML will "fill out". You can see on lines 20 and 23, the definition
of constructors for the struct (in C++ this is perfectly legit, 
structs are just classes with only public members). On line 23, we have
a constructor that constructs the parameter struct from XML.
There is also a write function to write out the parameter struct.
The remaining members are:
<li>Line 29 contains a member called <em>frequency</em>. In Monte
Carlo evolutions this can be used to control how often the measurement
is carried out</li>
<li>Lines 32 and 33 hold strings called prop_id and gauge_id respectively.
These will be filled out with the names of the input propagator and 
the input gauge field from the named maps respectively</li>
<li>Finally on line 35 we have a string to hold the name of 
an XML file. This is to support the behaviour you saw in tutorial 1,
that we can redirect the output of the measurement to its own private
XML file.</li>
</ul>

<p>The measurement itself is declared starting at line 39. We define it as
<blockquote><tt>
class InlineMyMeas : public AbsInlineMeasurement
</tt></blockquote>
to show that it is a subclass of <tt>AbsInlineMeasurement</tt>. We declare
a bunch of public functions:
<ul>
  <li>A destructor, which should clean up when the object is destroyed. Right now there is not anything to clean up, so the destructor has an empty body <tt>{}</tt></li>
  <li>A constructor to make a measurement from a parameter struct. This just 
copies the input params struct into the private param struct of the class.</li>
  <li>A copy constructor, to allow us to copy the object. Again this just copies over the internal parameter structure.</li>
  <li>a function called <tt>getFrequency</tt> which just returns the frequency
  element of the internal parameters struct. This can be used by HMC to decide
whether it is time to make a measurement</li>
  <li>the <tt>operator()</tt> which allows objects of this kind of measurement
to be used like functions</li>
</ul></p>
<p>We also have a private function called <tt>func()</tt>. I'll say more about this later.</p>

<p>You do not need to modify this file</p>

<h2>The source file: <tt>inline_my_meas.cc</tt></h2>
<p>
Edit the source file <tt>inline_my_meas.cc</tt>.</p>

<p>The first interesting thing you should look at is the function
<tt>createMeasurement</tt> on line 16. It takes an XML reader and 
a path. It uses these to first create an <tt>InlineMyMeas::Param</tt>
parameter structure which it uses to dynamically allocate and instantiate
a new <tt>InlineMyMeas</tt>. <em>It is this function, associated with 
a name that gets registered in the ObjectFactory</em>. This function
is local to this file (not defined in any header) and is private
to the <tt>InlineMyMeasEnv</tt> namespace.</p>

<p>
On line 26, we find the <tt>string</tt> that is the <em>name</em>
of the measurement that was declared <tt>extern</tt> in the <tt>.h</tt>
file. <em>This is the string which must appear in the <tt>&lt;Name&gt;
&lt;/Name&gt;</tt> tags of the XML. It is the name with which the <tt>createMeasurement</tt> function is associated in the Object Factory.</em></p>

<p>The actual registration is done in the <tt>registerAll()</tt> function 
on line 33. This function may be called many times (eg by other measurements
that depend on our one) but should perform the registration only once. 
To keep track of whether things are registered or not, we have a state
variable (a boolean) called <tt>registered</tt> on line 30. We want
this state variable to be invisible outside the <tt>InlineMyMeas</tt>
namespace, so we enclose it in yet another layer of hiding -- an anonymous
namespace which is declared as a <tt>namespace { ... };</tt> ie a namespace
with no actual name. </p>

<p>The actual call to perform the registration of the
creation function in the ObjectFactory is done on line 37.
The factory itself is a <em>class</em> called:
<blockquote><tt>
TheInlineMeasurementFactory
</tt></blockquote></p>
<p>The factory is a special construction called a <em>singleton</em>. This is much like a global variable but special C++ tricks are used to ensure that 
there really can be only one of it. A reference to the single instance of the factory is returned by the <tt>Instance()</tt> function defined in the factory class. This is a static function in the class, rather than a member function belonging to a particular object, hence the <tt>::</tt> notation. Once we get the reference to the factory object, we use the <tt>registerObject()</tt> member function of the object (back to <tt>.</tt> notation for memeber functions). The <tt>registered</tt> function in the namespace is updated with the return value of <tt>register()</tt> function.<p>

<p>Now there is one problem. If there is no reference in the main program
to the <tt>registered</tt> variable, the compiler may <em>not even link in</em>
this object file into the final executable. This is why we had to explicitly
call the <tt>registerAll</tt> function in the <tt>chroma.cc</tt> file.
If we were adding this module to the library, we would do this in
a file called:
<blockquote><tt>
chroma/lib/meas/inline/inline_aggregate.cc
</tt></blockquote> or one of its sub-aggregate files.  In
the <tt>chroma</tt> application in the <tt>linkageHack</tt> function,
you'd only have to call the aggregated <tt>registerAll</tt> function.
</p>

<p>Lines 48-102 deal with XML input and output for the parameter structure,
these include reader and writer functions, and constructors for the parameter
structure, including one to construct the param struct for XML.</p>

<p>Lines 104-131</p> We code the <tt>operator()</tt> here, or rather
just a springboard for it. This routine just has a look to see if we
requested a separate XML file for our measurement or not. If we have
then it will open one for us. If we haven't it will pass on its
input XML writer. In both cases it will call the function <b><tt>func()</tt></b>
where all the real work is done. (The function <tt>func()</tt> was 
declared as private in the header file. An external user cannot see it. It is only 
accessible to the <tt>InlineMyMeas</tt> class. Strictly speaking it
is not necessary to split the work out into <tt>func</tt> we could well
have done it all in the <tt>operator()</tt>. However this is a pattern
that was developed when turning external programs into inline measurements.
Essentially the code from <tt>main()</tt> more or less got pasted into 
<tt>func</tt>.


<p>Finally the main code to do the actual computation for the measurement 
begins on line 136. It is the <tt>operator()</tt> function for the measurement.
It currently takes 2 parameters
<ul>
  <li>An update number. This is mostly for use in HMC routines</li>
  <li>A reference to an XML writer to output measurement related XML</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>In this function one can write what was effectively contained in the 
main programs before.</p>

<h3>Accessing Named Objects</h3>
<p>
How do we get at the gauge field. How do we get at the propagator?
Recall that now, measurements communicate through named objects.
Even the gauge field is a named object which could be read/written
with another measurement. The gauge field described in the <tt>Cfg_t</tt>
tags of the XML file is given a default name: <tt>default_gauge_field</tt>.
This is why you will see many measurements with <tt>gauge_id</tt> of <tt>default_gauge_field</tt>. For our measurement, we read the <tt>gauge_id</tt> and 
<tt>prop_id</tt>-s on lines 65 and 61 respectively.</p>

<p>Currently our named object store will return references to objects
stored in it. References are kind of funny in C++. Once declared they
immediately need to be given a value otherwise they are considered to be 
'dangling'. Hence it is not a good idea to declare them in a <tt>try {} catch{}</tt> block. On the other hand, we need a <tt>try {} </tt> catch block in case our named object store throws an exception. So instead we'll first just check
whether our data is in the store in a <tt>try{} </tt> block, and if we get
past the catch part without exceptions, we can repeat the steps and
actually bind the results to references. This is a bit kack-handed, and
if I did this today, I'd just return a pointer.</p>

<p>Anyway, look at the code between lines 149 and 179. This is where we 
access our named object buffer (and throw away the referene). On line 153 we try to get the
gauge field from a map. If this lookup fails it throws a (string)
excption. If the lookup succeeds but the named object is 
not a <tt>multi1d&lt;LatticeColorMatrix&gt;</tt> then a <tt>bad_cast</tt>
exception is thrown</p>

<p>If we succeed with line 153, we go on to line 154 and try to 
get the record XML corresponding to the gauge field.</p>

<p>We repeat the last two steps for the input propagator on lines
157 - 160. Observe, that the <tt>getData</tt> function on line
157 is templated by <tt>LatticePropagator</tt> now.</p?

<p>Lines 163-179 contain two exception catching clauses - the first
deals with the case where our object id is in the map, but is the 
wrong type, and the second deals with the case when we fail to 
find the object_id in the map at all.</p>

<p>By the time we reach line 187 we know that 
<ul>
  <li>The gauge field and propagator are both in the Named Object
  maps. </li>
  <li>We have their record XML in XML Buffer writers.</li>
</ul>
 So knowing that we will encounter no surprises from the map we 
bind references to both the gauge field (line 187) and the propagator
(line 191). Thereafter in the rest of our measurements we just
refer to the reference names -- <tt>u</tt> for the gauge field and 
<tt>prop</tt> for the prop.


<h3>Named Objects and the XML input file</h3>
<p>
Look at (edit) the supplied XML file <tt>chroma_my_meas.ini.xml</tt>.
You will see that we load the propagator in the second inline measurement:
<blockquote>
<tt> &lt;elem&gt;<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Name&gt;QIO_READ_NAMED_OBJECT&lt;/Name&gt;<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;File&gt;<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;file_name&gt;./propagator_0&lt;/file_name&gt;<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;file_volfmt&gt;SINGLEFILE&lt;/file_volfmt&gt;<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/File&gt;<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;NamedObject&gt;<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;object_type&gt;LatticePropagator&lt;/object_type&gt;<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;object_id&gt;prop&lt;/object_id&gt;<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/NamedObject&gt;<br/>
    &lt;/elem&gt;<br/>
</tt>
</blockquote>



<p><em>And that is all there is to writing a measurement</em></p>

<h2>Exercise 1: Compile and run the code</h2>
<p>
Now that we have gone through the code for the inline measurement,
build and run the code. Remember that the <tt>Makefile</tt> may
need to be updated to point to the chroma installation in 
<blockquote><tt>
/usr/local/chroma/scalar
</tt></blockquote>
</p>

<p>Run the application with the supplied XML input file. Have a look at the
XML output file</p>

<h2>Exercise 2: Add your own code</h2>
<p>
Now add your own code to the measurement at line 130. You could re-use
some of the code you wrote for Tutorial 2.
</p>

<h2>Play Away</h2>
<p>
Try various things. Change the name of your measurement from <tt>MY_MEAS</tt>
to something else. Add some XML parameters. <em>Go forth and hack!</em>
